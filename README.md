# `cimg-cron` - scheduled tasks for Convenience Images

This is the repository where we handle scheduled tasks (cron jobs) for Convenience Images as a whole.
There are two workflows:

1. Readme Sync - this workflows runs through every image and syncs its readme with Docker Hub.
2. DB testing - this runs through the databases images and makes sure they work as intended.
